## About this project

Tech Stacks: [ Typescript, Three Js Library, WebXR ] <br>

I have tried to make this project in Vanilla Javascript with Three Js Library and WebXR Api. But Since that Api was depricated the app didn't worked on a few devices.<br>
So i recreated this project with Typescript while following the current docs. I have separated the modules to make the code look more clean and easy to modify or rewrite. <br>
This approach works fine with on devices i tried with.
