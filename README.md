## About this project

Tech Stacks: [ Typescript, Three Js Library, WebXR ] <br>

This project is made with Typescript, Three Js Library, WebXR. This app renders 3D objects in a AR Environment. <br>
It has the **Hit Point** feature implemented which allow users to place the object on selected area. The Scale of the object is defined based on the Hit Point. <br>

Previously i tried to make this with Vanila Js, Three Js and WebXR API and with a different code pattern but since that Api was depricated the app didn't worked on a few devices.<a href="https://github.com/heysaadad/threejs-ar"> See it from here.</a><br>
So i recreated this project by following the current docs.<br>
The modules are separated to make the code look more clean and easy to modify or rewrite. <br>

This approach works fine on devices i tried with and doesn't have the compatibility issue anymore. <br>
